# SqueezeNetv0.1

## SqueezeNet implementation from scratch for standford car dataset using tensorflow 1.5.0

## SimpleCNN to test the pipeline using MNIST dataset

## Challenges trying to resolve : 
   1. Large number of classes
   2. Each classes having less number of images

standford car dataset - https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

### to dos:
    1. Apply Data Augmentations
    2. Pre-train squeezeNet using large dataset
